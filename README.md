# Stellar Defenders

## Descrição
Stellar Defenders is a strategy and logic puzzle game with 2D physics simulation set in space battles. The player takes on the role of a fleet captain who must protect their home planet using orbital mechanics concepts such as gravitational assists and interplanetary transfers. The main goal is to provide a fun and educational experience, combining realistic space physics with challenges that require reasoning and strategic planning, while giving the player freedom to explore different solutions.

Gameplay revolves around assembling fleets with a limited budget, positioning and launching ships within a gravitational field influenced by planets, moons, and asteroids. Interaction takes place in a central hub (the mothership), where the player can access menus and start levels. During battles, the player purchases and positions ships, sets their direction and velocity, and observes the results in a physics simulation. Levels increase progressively in difficulty, and the game ends once all are completed.

The game was developed in C++ with the SDL library, featuring simple 2D artwork with geometric sprites and pixel art. The project is aimed at an academic audience or players who enjoy logic and accessible mental challenges, even without prior gaming experience. The interface is intuitive, with the core mechanics controlled via keyboard and mouse, and includes a space-themed soundtrack and sound effects.
